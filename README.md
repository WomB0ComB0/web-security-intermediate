To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.4. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## Security Measures

1. Authentication and Authorization
   - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Requires users to provide multiple forms of verification before granting access.
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assigns permissions based on user roles to limit access to sensitive data and functionalities.

2. Data Encryption
   - Transport Layer Security (TLS): Encrypts data transmitted between clients and servers to prevent interception.
   - End-to-End Encryption: Ensures data remains encrypted throughout its journey, accessible only by the sender and intended recipient.

3. Input Validation
   - Sanitization: Removes potentially malicious data from user inputs.
   - Validation: Ensures inputs meet expected formats and constraints to prevent injection attacks.

4. Secure Session Management
   - Session Timeouts: Automatically terminates inactive sessions to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
   - Secure Cookies: Utilizes attributes like HttpOnly and Secure to protect session cookies.

5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
   - Anti-CSRF Tokens: Implements tokens to verify the legitimacy of user requests.

6. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection
   - Content Security Policy (CSP): Defines approved content sources to mitigate XSS attacks.
   - Output Encoding: Encodes user-generated content before rendering to prevent script execution.

7. Security Headers
   - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS): Enforces secure (HTTPS) connections to the server.
   - X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type.

8. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)
   - Monitoring: Identifies suspicious activities or policy violations.
   - Prevention: Blocks detected threats in real-time.

9. Regular Security Audits and Vulnerability Assessments
   - Penetration Testing: Simulates attacks to identify potential weaknesses.
   - Automated Scanning: Utilizes tools to detect known vulnerabilities.

10. Secure Development Practices
    - Code Reviews: Conducts regular reviews to identify security flaws.
    - Secure Coding Standards: Adheres to established guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities.

11. Logging and Monitoring
    - Comprehensive Logging: Captures detailed logs of user activities and system events.
    - Real-Time Monitoring: Analyzes logs continuously to detect anomalies.

12. Patch Management
    - Timely Updates: Ensures software and dependencies are up-to-date with security patches.

13. Firewall and Network Security
    - Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Filters and monitors HTTP traffic to and from a web application.
    - Network Firewalls: Controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

14. Backup and Recovery
    - Regular Backups: Maintains copies of critical data to recover from data loss events.
    - Disaster Recovery Plans: Establishes procedures to restore operations after significant disruptions.

15. Security Awareness Training
    - Employee Education: Trains staff on security best practices and threat recognition.

16. Third-Party Component Management
    - Dependency Management: Regularly updates and assesses third-party libraries and frameworks for vulnerabilities.

17. Compliance and Regulatory Adherence
    - GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS: Ensures adherence to relevant industry standards and regulations.

18. Secure API Management
    - API Gateways: Manages and secures API traffic.
    - Rate Limiting: Controls the number of requests a client can make to prevent abuse.

19. Mobile Security Measures
    - App Sandboxing: Isolates applications to prevent malicious interactions.
    - Secure Data Storage: Encrypts sensitive data stored on mobile devices.

20. Physical Security
    - Access Controls: Restricts physical access to servers and networking equipment.
    - Surveillance: Implements monitoring to deter and detect unauthorized physical access.
